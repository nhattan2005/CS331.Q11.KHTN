## Introduction

This project addresses the problem of **Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS)**, which aims to reduce the cost of pixel-level annotations by leveraging image-level labels.

The system combines **TransCAM** (based on Transformer Attention) and **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** to overcome the limitations of traditional CAM-based methods:

1. **Partial Activation:** Only the most distinctive parts of objects are detected.
2. **False Activation:** Activation spreads to background regions.

---

## Features

- **SAM + CAM Integration:**  
  Combines SAM-generated masks with CAM-based pseudo labels to enhance segmentation quality.

- **DeepLabV3+ Training:**  
  Trains a DeepLabV3+ model on enhanced masks for improved segmentation performance.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Calculates mIoU, precision, and recall for both pseudo labels and enhanced masks.

- **Web Demo:**  
  Provides an interactive Streamlit-based web application for inference and visualization.

## Web Demo

The project includes a **Streamlit-based web demo** for end-to-end segmentation from input images without requiring any prompts.

### Features:

- Upload images (JPG, PNG).
- Automatic segmentation and class detection.
- Visualization of:
  - Original Image
  - Segmentation Mask
  - Overlayed Image (Mask + Original)

### How to Run the Demo:

1. Navigate to the Web_demo directory:
   ```bash
   cd Web_demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```
